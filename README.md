This is the source code for all the sound interactions in the interactive soundwalk "Transverse"  
Learn more about the project at https://transverse-documentation.vercel.app

Location related sound interactions are removed and replaced by buttons and sliders for access without being in the soundwalk zone at Kwun Tong, Hong Kong.

There might be redundant code, as the code is extracted from the original soundwalk app.
Language change is hard coded instead of using a localization library, please ignore how the text display is implemented.
